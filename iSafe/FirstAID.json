Different types are available:\n● Digital thermometers are an accurate and easy way to take a temperature from the armpit or mouth. For children under five, take their temperature from under their armpit.\n● Ear thermometers are quick and easy to use, but expensive. The reading may not be accurate if the thermometer isn't correctly placed in the ear.\n● Strip-type thermometers are not an accurate way of taking a temperature. They show the temperature of the skin, not the body.\n● Mercury-in-glass thermometers are no longer sold and should not be used. They can break, releasing small shards of glass and highly poisonous mercury.\n\n\bWhat's a high temperature?\n● A fever (high temperature) is generally considered to be 38C (100.4F) or over."

                                   "answer": "You can check your pulse by counting how many times your heart beats in a minute. This is also known as your heart rate.\nYour heart rate can vary, depending on what you're doing. For example, it will be slower if you're sleeping and faster if you're exercising.\n\n\bFinding your pulse\n\nYou can find your pulse in places where an artery passes close to your skin, such as your wrist or neck.\nTo find your pulse in your wrist:\n\n\t● hold out one of your hands, with your palm facing upwards and your elbow slightly bent.\n\t● put the first finger (index) and middle finger of your other hand on the inside of your wrist, at the base of your thumb.\n\t● press your skin lightly until you can feel your pulse – if you can't feel anything, you may need to press a little harder or move your fingers around. \nTo find your pulse in your neck, press the same two fingers on the side of your neck in the soft hollow area just beside your windpipe.\n\n\bChecking your pulse\n\nWhen you find your pulse, either:\n\n\t● count the number of beats you feel for one full minute,\n\t● count the number for 30 seconds and multiply by two.\n\nThe figure you get is the number of times per minute your heart is beating. It's known as your resting heart rate, as long as you've been resting for at least five minutes before checking your pulse.\nYou can also check if your pulse is regular or irregular by feeling its rhythm for about 20-30 seconds. Occasional irregular heartbeats, such as missed beats, are very common.\n\n\bWhat's a normal heart rate?\nMost adults have a resting heart rate of 60-100 beats per minute (bpm).\nThe fitter you are, the lower your resting heart rate is likely to be. For example, athletes may have a resting heart rate of 40-60 bpm or lower.\nYou should contact your GP if you think your heart rate is continuously above 120 bpm or below 40 bpm, although this could just be normal for you.\n\n\bExercise and your pulse\n\nIf you check your pulse while you're exercising or immediately afterwards, it may give an indication of your fitness level. A heart rate monitor is also useful for recording your heart rate when resting and during exercise.\nAerobic activities such as walking, running and swimming are good types of exercise, because they increase your heart and breathing rates."

If the baby is distressed and unable to cry, cough or breathe, back blows (firm slaps on the back with the heel of the hand) may help.\n\n\t● Lie the baby face down across or along your lap, with their head lower than their bottom.\n\t● Support the baby’s head from underneath by placing your thumb on one side of their jaw and one or two fingers on the other side. This is to make sure their airway is open.\n\t● Be careful not to press on the neck or the soft skin under the lower jaw.\n\t● Give up to five firm slaps to the baby’s back between their shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. (The heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist.)\n\t● Pause between each blow to see if the blockage has cleared. Do not poke your fingers into the baby’s mouth unless you can see and reach the blockage, as you may push it further in.\n\n\bChest thrusts for babies under one year old\n\nIn babies under one year old, chest thrusts are used in an emergency to clear a blockage from their airway. Important: do not use abdominal thrusts with babies under one year old.\n\t● Lie the baby face up along your arm, and lay your arm along or across your lap to support it.\n\t● Support the back of the baby’s head by cupping the lower part of your hand.\n\t● Find the breastbone, and place two fingers on the lower half of it.\n\t● Give five sharp chest thrusts (pushes) with your fingers, compressing the chest by about a third of its depth.\n\t● Check whether the blockage has cleared.

They will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves.\nTo help with mild choking in an adult or child over one year old:\n\n\t● Encourage the person to keep coughing to try and clear the blockage.\n\t● Ask the person to try to spit out the object if it's in their mouth.\n\t● Don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them as they may bite you accidentally.\n\n\bSevere choking: back blows and abdominal thrusts\n\nWhere choking is severe, the person will not be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. Without help, they will eventually become unconscious.\n\nTo help an adult or child over one year old:\n\n\t● Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down.\n\t● Give up to five sharp blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. (The heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist).\n\t● Check if the blockage has cleared.\nImportant: Don't give abdominal thrusts to babies under one year old or to pregnant women.\n\n\t● Stand behind the person who is choking.\n\t● Place your arms around their waist and bend them forward.\n\t● Clench one fist and place it right above their belly button.\n\t● Put the other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards.\n\t● Repeat this movement up to five times."

This will prevent the burn getting worse.\n\t● Do not use ice, iced water, creams, or greasy substances (such as butter) to soothe the burn.\n\t● Remove any clothes or jewellery from around the burn, unless they are sticking to it.\n\t● Cover the burn using strips of cling film, rather than wrapping it around a limb. A clean plastic bag is suitable to use for burns on your hand.\n\t● If the burn is painful, taking a mild painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, can help. However, always check the packaging to make sure that you take the correct dosage and never give aspirin to children under 16 years of age.\n\n\bTreating chemical burns\n\nIf a chemical, such as bleach or acid, burns your skin, you should follow the advice below.\n\n\t● Wearing protective gloves, remove any chemicals from the skin by running the affected area under cool tap water for 20 minutes, or more. If the chemical involved is in powder form, such as lime, brush it off the skin before running the skin under water.\n\t● Remove any jewellery, or clothing, that may have been exposed to the chemical.\n\t● Apply a cool wet towel to help relieve pain.\n\t● If you experience an increased sensation of burning, rewash the skin for several more minutes."

                                   "answer": "Broken bones can happen after an accident such as a fall, or by being hit by an object. The three most common signs of a fracture are:\n\n\t● pain\n\t● swelling\n\t● deformity\n\nHowever, it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether a bone is broken if it is not displaced.\nIf you have broken a bone, you may experience the following:\n\n\t● you may hear or feel a snap or a grinding noise as the injury happens\n\t● there may be swelling, bruising or tenderness around the injured area\n\t● you may feel pain when you put weight on the injury, touch it, press it or move it\n\t● the injured part may look deformed – in severe breaks, the broken bone may be poking through the skin\n\nIn addition, as a result of the shock of breaking a bone, you may feel faint, dizzy or sick.\nIf the break is small or it is just a crack (fracture), you may not feel much pain or even realise that you have broken a bone.\nBut if you think that you have broken or fractured a bone, you should seek medical help as soon as possible. Go to your nearest  accident and emergency (A&E) department for a broken arm or leg. If you think you may have broken your toe or finger you can go to a minor injury unit or urgent care centre.\nThe broken bone must be properly aligned and held in place (often with a plaster cast) so that it heals in the correct position. If you do not receive the correct treatment, you could develop a serious infection or a permanent deformity. You may also develop long-term problems with your joints.\nIt's important not to eat or drink anything if you think you've broken a bone, as you may need a general anaesthetic (be put to sleep) to allow doctors to realign it.\nOlder people and those who have osteoporosis should be particularly careful, because their bones are weaker and may break more easily.\nIf you have broken or fractured a bone, visit your GP or local walk-in centre. However, if the break is serious, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department."

                                   "answer": "The key points when applying a bandage are:\n\n\t● Make sure the person is comfortable and tell them what you are doing.\n\t● Make sure you work from the side of the injury and do not have to lean across their body.\n\t● Keep the injured part of the body supported in the position it will be in when the bandage is on.\n\t● Make sure you use the right size bandage – different parts of the body need different widths of bandage.\n\t● If possible, do not cover fingers or toes when bandaging a limb, so that you can easily check the circulation.\n\t● Apply the bandage firmly, but not tightly, and secure the end by folding it over and tying a knot in the end. You can also use a safety pin, adhesive (sticky) tape, or a bandage clip.\n\t● As soon as you have put the bandage on, ask the person if the bandage feels too tight and check the circulation by pressing on a fingernail or a piece of skin until it turns pale. If the colour doesn’t return straight away, the bandage may be too tight, so you should loosen it. Limbs can swell up after an injury, so check the circulation every 10 minutes after you have put the bandage on.\n\nThere are three main types of bandage: roller, tubular and triangular.\n\n\bRoller bandages\nThere are three types of roller bandage:\n\n\t● bandages that are made of open-weave material allow ventilation, but do not put pressure on wounds and do not support joints\n\t● elasticated bandages mould to a person's body shape, and are used to secure dressings and support soft tissue injuries like sprains\n\t● crepe bandages are used to give firm support to injured joints\nTo apply a roller bandage:\n\n\t● keep the rolled part of the bandage above the injury and the unrolled part below the injury\n\t● begin by wrapping twice around the injury to hold the end in place\n\t● work up the limb, winding the bandage in spiralling turns, making sure that each new layer covers one-third to two-thirds of the previous one\n\t● finish by wrapping the bandage around once more and securing the end\n\nWhen applying bandages to elbows and knees (to hold dressings in place or support sprains or strains) flex the joint slightly, apply the bandage in a figure of eight and extend the bandage quite far on each side of the joint.\nWhen applying bandages on hands (to hold dressings in place or to support sprains and strains), work from the inside of the wrist using diagonal turns across the back of the hand to the end of the little finger, leaving the thumb free.\n\n\bTubular bandages\n\nTubular bandages are used to hold dressings on fingers or toes or support injured joints. They are made of seamless fabric tube. You can get elasticated ones to place over joints such as the ankle. Ones made of tubular gauze can be placed over fingers or toes, but they do not provide any pressure to stop bleeding.\nBefore placing a tubular bandage over an injury, you may need to cut it to a smaller size. Some tubular bandages come with a special device (an applicator) that is placed over the injured body part to help apply the bandage.\n\n\bTriangular bandages\n\nTriangular bandages can be used as large dressings, as slings to support a limb, or to secure a dressing in place.\nIf you are using a triangular bandage as a sling on an arm, you use it opened out. You should:\n\n\t● ask the person to hold their arm across their chest and support the arm while you work\n\t● put the bandage under the arm and around the back of the neck\n\t● put the other half of the bandage over the arm to meet at the shoulder and tie into a knot\n\t● tuck the loose ends of the bandage in at the elbow, or use a pin\n\nIf you are using a triangular bandage to support a lower limb or large dressing, fold it in half horizontally, so the point of the triangle touches the middle of the long edge. Then fold it in half again in the same direction to make a broad strip."

Once they are out of the wrapping, they are no longer sterile. When applying a sterile dressing pad:\n\n\t● clean and dry the wound and surrounding skin\n\t● hold the bandage on either side of the pad\n\t● lay the pad directly on the wound\n\t● wind the short end once around the limb and the pad\n\t● wind the other end around the limb to cover the whole pad\n\t● tie the ends together over the pad to secure it, and put slight pressure on the wound\n\nDressings should be replaced on a regular basis.\nIf the wound is severe, apply the dressing and seek medical advice.\n\n\bPlasters (adhesive dressings)\n\nPlasters are made from a piece of gauze and have an adhesive (sticky) backing. They are usually wrapped in single sterile packs. They sometimes come in different shapes and sizes, or you can cut them to size. Some plasters are waterproof. When applying a plaster:\n\n\t● clean and dry the wound and surrounding skin (see How do I clean a wound? for more information)\n\t● unwrap the plaster and hold it by the protective strips over the backing with the pad side facing down\n\t● peel back the strips, but don't remove them\n\t● place the pad on the wound, pull away the strips, and press the edges of the plaster down\n\nPlasters should be replaced every few hours.\n\nA small number of people are allergic to the adhesive strips – try to find out if this is the case before applying a plaster."

However, you might need to apply pressure to the area, and if an arm or leg is affected, you should raise it above heart level.\n\nBefore putting on a plaster or other dressing, you will need to clean the wound. Follow the steps below to ensure that it does not become infected:\n\n\t● Wash and dry your hands thoroughly.\n\t● If you have any cuts on your own hands, you should cover them and wear disposable gloves.\n\t● If treating someone else, tell them what you are doing.\n\t● Make sure that the person is sitting or lying down.\n\t● If the wound has something embedded in it, leave it in place until you seek medical advice (see below).\n\t● Clean the wound under running tap water, saline (a salt water solution) or use an alcohol-free wipe, gauze pad or soft cloth, but do not use antiseptic, because it may damage the skin.\n\t● Soak the gauze or cloth in the saline solution or water, and gently dab or wipe the skin with it.\n\t● Gently pat the area dry using a clean towel or a pad of tissues, but nothing fluffy such as a cotton wool ball, where strands of material can get stuck to the wound.\n\t● Apply a sterile dressing, such as a bandage or plaster.\n\t● If blood soaks through the bandage, leave it in place and another bandage, and continue to apply pressure on the wound.\n\n\bWhen to seek medical advice\n\nYou should always get medical advice if the injury:\n\n\t● does not stop bleeding\n\t● is very large or very deep\n\t● has something embedded in it\n\t● is to an artery or on a joint crease\n\t● is red, sore and painful, or has pus coming out (it may be infected)\n\t● is an old wound that looks like it might be infected\n\t● was caused by a bite (all animal and human bites need medical attention)\n\nMost human bites are the result of a \"closed fist injury\", where one person punches another person in the teeth and cuts their hand. Typical symptoms include small cuts to the hand and red, swollen and painful skin.\nIf you are not sure how serious your injury is, it is best to get a healthcare professional to check it. If you have a large wound or a deep cut, they will need to examine it carefully to assess how serious it is. They will also clean the wound thoroughly before stitching it up.\n\n\bTetanus vaccination\n\nIt is very important to check that you are up to date with your tetanus jabs if your skin is broken in an injury, or if you are bitten. You will be given a booster jab if your GP thinks you need one."

Do not move, twist or turn the piercing as this may cause any hardened discharge to tear the piercing, allowing bacteria into the wound.\n\n\bOther signs of infection\n\nAs well as discharge, other signs your body piercing could be infected include:\n\n\t● the piercing site being red and swollen\n\t● the piercing site feeling warm\n\t● the piercing site being painful – particularly if it's throbbing or if the pain is spreading\n\t● bleeding\n\t● having a high temperature (fever)\n\t● feeling generally unwell\n\nYou should see your GP if you have any signs of infection.\n\nDon't remove the jewellery in your piercing unless your doctor advises you to. Leaving it in place will help ensure proper drainage and may prevent an abscess (collection of pus) forming.\n\nIn many cases, the infection can be treated without losing the piercing. Minor infections may be treated with antibiotic cream, and a more serious infection may need antibiotic tablets. Your doctor will be able to give you advice about which treatment is best for you."

                                   "question": "How should I care for my plaster cast?",
                                   "answer": "Plaster casts are made up of a bandage and a hard covering (usually plaster of Paris). They allow broken bones in the arm or leg to heal by holding them in place, and usually need to stay on for 4 and 12 weeks.\n\nTaking good care of your cast will help ensure a better recovery.\n\n\bPlaster cast care advice\n\nKeep your arm or leg raised on a soft surface, such as a pillow, for as long as possible in the first few days. This will help any swelling to go down and will help the cast dry correctly.\n\nDon't get your plaster cast wet. This will weaken it, and your bone will no longer be properly supported.\n\nYou can use a plastic bag to cover up the cast when you have a bath or shower. Try using sticky tape or a rubber band to seal the bag at the top and bottom to make it as watertight as possible.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to buy special covers for plaster casts to keep them dry. Ask your local pharmacist (chemist) for more information. If your cast gets wet, contact your hospital for advice as soon as possible.\n\nAlways remove the bag as soon as you can to avoid causing sweating, which could also damage the cast.\n\nEven if the plaster cast makes your skin feel very itchy, don't be tempted to poke anything underneath it, as this could cause a nasty sore. The itchiness should settle down after a few days.\n\n\bMore plaster cast tips\n\n\t● Exercise any joints that aren't covered by the cast – such as your elbow, knee, fingers or toes – to help improve your circulation.\n\t● Avoid getting small objects, powders and sprays inside your cast, as they could irritate your skin.\n\t● Don't try to alter the length or position of your cast.\n\t● Don't lift anything heavy or drive until the cast has been removed.\n\t● Use crutches or a sling, as advised by your health professional.\n\t● Use painkillers if you experience any pain.\n\nYou can usually return to school or work with a cast, but you should avoid strenuous activities that may damage the broken bone or cast.\n\n\bPlaster cast problems\n\nYou should go to your local hospital's accident and emergency (A&E) department if:\n\n\t● your plaster cast still feels too tight after keeping it elevated for 24 hours\n\t● your fingers or toes on the affected limb feel swollen, tingly, painful (even after taking painkillers) or numb\n\t● your fingers or toes turn blue or white\n\t● your cast feels too loose\n\t● your cast is broken or cracked\n\t● the skin underneath or around the edge of your cast feels sore\n\t● there is an unpleasant smell or discharge coming from your cast."

                                   "answer": "If you've been prescribed compression stockings for a condition that affects your circulation, you may need to wear them for several years and, in some cases, for the rest of your life.\n\nIf you need to wear stockings after having deep vein thrombosis (DVT), you should wear them for at least two years.\n\nDVT is a blood clot that forms in one of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs.\n\n\bWhat are compression stockings for?\n\nCompression stockings are specially designed to apply pressure to your lower legs, helping to maintain blood flow and reduce discomfort and swelling. They may be prescribed by your GP if you have a condition that causes poor blood flow in your legs, such as:\n\n\t● varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins)\n\t● lymphoedema (when your body's tissues swell up painfully)\n\nCompression stockings may also be recommended after having DVT to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome (pain and swelling in your calf that can sometimes occur after having DVT), or another DVT from occurring.\n\n\bWearing compression stockings\n\nCompression stockings come in a variety of sizes, lengths and colours. They're also available with different strengths of compression.\n\nYour legs will be measured to see what size stockings you need, and your GP or nurse will check they fit properly. You may need to wear them on both legs or on just one leg.\n\nYou should wear your compression stockings during the day and take them off before going to bed. Put them on again first thing in the morning.\n\nYou should be given at least two stockings or two pairs if you're wearing them on both legs. This means you can wear one stocking (or one pair) while the other one is being washed and dried. Hand wash your stockings at about 40C /104F (comfortable hand temperature) and dry them away from direct heat.\n\nYour GP will monitor your progress. You should have your legs measured again and your stockings replaced every 3-6 months."

                                   "question": "Is it better to have a bath or shower after surgery?",
                                   "answer": "It's usually better to have a shower after an operation because you can control the flow of water and, if necessary, prevent your wound getting wet.\n\nAvoid having a bath as your wound shouldn't be soaked in water until it has healed. Soaking the wound could cause the scar tissue to soften and reopen the wound.\n\nYou can have a shower 48 hours after surgery. However, you should check with your surgeon as it may depend on the type of surgery you've had and how your wound has been closed.\n\nYou'll be given advice about caring for your wound before you're discharged from hospital.\n\n\bDressings\n\nSome dressings are waterproof and can withstand a small amount of water – for example, the spray from a shower. However, don't submerge your dressing underwater. If you're not sure whether your dressing is waterproof, avoid getting it wet altogether.\n\nDepending on where your dressing is, you could cover the area to stop it getting wet in the bath or shower. For example, after having hand surgery, you may be able to wear a large rubber glove or cover your hand with a plastic bag.\n\nYou can also buy waterproof covers to protect a dressing or plaster cast on your arm or leg so you can shower without getting your wound wet. Ask one of the healthcare professionals treating you if you would like more information.\n\n\bStitches (sutures) or clips\n\nAvoid getting stitches or clips wet. If you can cover the stitches so they don't get wet, you may be able to have a shower.\n\n\bPlaster casts\n\nYou should not get your plaster cast wet. You may be able to hold your arm or leg out of the shower or wash around your cast.\n\n\bAfter your stitches, clips and dressings have been removed\n\nYou should be able to wash normally after your stitches, dressings and clips have been removed. However, it's usually better to have a shower until the wound has healed to avoid soaking it completely. Afterwards, pat your wound and the surrounding area dry."

                                   "answer": "It will depend on the regulations of your airline and the nature of your surgery.\n\n\bCheck before you fly\n\nEach airline has its own regulations about flying after surgery. Check with your airline before you fly, particularly if you've had complicated surgery.\n\nIf you've had any kind of major surgery, you should also check with your surgeon or GP before flying.\n\n\bTypes of surgery\n\nAs a rough guide, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says that before flying, you should allow:\n\n\t● one day after simple cataract or corneal laser surgery\n\t● one day after a colonoscopy\n\t● one to two days after keyhole surgery \n\t● four to five days after simple abdominal surgery\n\t● seven days after more complicated eye surgery\n\t● 10 days after chest surgery or a coronary artery bypass graft\n\t● 10 days after more complicated abdominal surgery\n\nFor other types of surgery, allow:\n\n\t● one to two days after surgery where a plaster cast is applied – if you have a broken arm or leg, it will affect where you can sit; for example, you won't be allowed to sit in an emergency seat and you may have to purchase an extra seat if you cannot bend your knee to sit normally\n\t● two to six weeks after surgery for retinal detachment that involves having a gas bubble put in your eye\n\n\bRisk of DVT\n\nIf you're flying after recent surgery, especially on the hips or knees, you're at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs.\n\nOther factors may also increase your risk of DVT, including if you:\n\n\t● have had DVT before\n\t● have had blood clots already\n\t● have a family history of blood clot\n\t● are overweight or obese\n\t● are pregnant\n\nIf you're at high risk of DVT, speak to your GP before flying. They may get advice from your surgeon, for example, or recommend that you delay your trip.\n\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of DVT, such as drinking plenty of water and moving around on the plane.\n\nThe risk of developing a travel-related DVT is low, even if you are classed as moderate to high risk.\n\n\bTravelling with a pacemaker\n\nPeople who have had a pacemaker or an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) fitted may travel without problems once they are medically stable.\n\n\bTravel insurance\n\nCheck your travel insurance policy carefully, as you may need to inform the insurance company that you've recently had surgery. This could increase the cost of your travel insurance."

                                   "question": "How soon can I go swimming after surgery?",
                                   "answer": "It depends on the type of surgery you've had, but you shouldn't go swimming until:\n\n\t● your surgeon, GP or physiotherapist has confirmed it's safe for you to do so\n\t● your wound has healed (it shouldn't be submerged under water) – ask your surgeon how long your wound will take to heal\n\t● your wound doesn't cause pain\n\nGenerally, after your stitches have been removed or have dissolved and your wound has fully healed, you should be able to swim in the sea or a swimming pool. Once a wound has healed, the risk of infection decreases.\n\nStitches can usually be removed within 7 to 10 days of surgery, although it depends on the type of wound. Absorbable stitches can take longer to dissolve.\n\nYou should avoid swimming for longer if you have another condition that increases your risk of infection or delays healing. You shouldn't swim if you have open wounds.\n\nYou should also avoid swimming if you're wearing a plaster cast or you have an external fixation device, until your surgeon advises that it's safe to do so.\n\n\bSwimming after different types of surgery\n\nDepending on the type of surgery, you may need to avoid swimming for some time, even after your wound has healed.\n\nBelow are some examples, but you should always check with the healthcare professionals treating you before swimming.\n\n\t● cornea transplant – avoid swimming for at least one month and until you're advised that it's safe; wear goggles to protect your eye from an impact injury and don't dive in\n\t● hip replacement – you should feel back to normal after 8 to 12 weeks, when you can return to your usual activities, such as swimming, but some surgeons advise against breaststroke\n\t● heart bypass surgery – you can swim after three months\n\t● cataract surgery – you may be able to swim wearing goggles after two weeks, and without goggles after four weeks\n\t● appendectomy (after having appendicitis) – you can swim from around 10 to 14 days afterwards, or once the wound has fully healed"
