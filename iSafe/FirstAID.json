This is also known as your heart rate.Your heart rate can vary, depending on what you're doing. For example, it will be slower if you're sleeping and faster if you're exercising.</p><h3>Finding your pulse</h3><p>You can find your pulse in places where an artery passes close to your skin, such as your wrist or neck.</p>To find your pulse in your wrist:<ul><li>hold out one of your hands, with your palm facing upwards and your elbow slightly bent.</li><li>put the first finger (index) and middle finger of your other hand on the inside of your wrist, at the base of your thumb.</li><li>press your skin lightly until you can feel your pulse – if you can't feel anything, you may need to press a little harder or move your fingers around.</li></ul><p>To find your pulse in your neck, press the same two fingers on the side of your neck in the soft hollow area just beside your windpipe.</p><h3>Checking your pulse</h3>When you find your pulse, either:<ul><li>count the number of beats you feel for one full minute</li><li>count the number for 30 seconds and multiply by two.</li></ul><p>The figure you get is the number of times per minute your heart is beating.

For example, athletes may have a resting heart rate of 40-60 bpm or lower</p><p>You should contact your GP if you think your heart rate is continuously above 120 bpm or below 40 bpm, although this could just be normal for you.</p><h3>Exercise and your pulse</h3><p>If you check your pulse while you're exercising or immediately afterwards, it may give an indication of your fitness level. A heart rate monitor is also useful for recording your heart rate when resting and during exercise.Aerobic activities such as walking, running and swimming are good types of exercise, because they increase your heart and breathing rates.</p></body></html>"

You can also use a safety pin, adhesive (sticky) tape, or a bandage clip.</li><li>As soon as you have put the bandage on, ask the person if the bandage feels too tight and check the circulation by pressing on a fingernail or a piece of skin until it turns pale. If the colour doesn’t return straight away, the bandage may be too tight, so you should loosen it. Limbs can swell up after an injury, so check the circulation every 10 minutes after you have put the bandage on.</li></ul><p>There are three main types of bandage: roller, tubular and triangular.</p><h3>Roller bandages</h3><p>There are three types of roller bandage:</p><ul><li>bandages that are made of open-weave material allow ventilation, but do not put pressure on wounds and do not support joints</li><li>elasticated bandages mould to a person's body shape, and are used to secure dressings and support soft tissue injuries like sprains</li><li>crepe bandages are used to give firm support to injured joints</li></ul><p>To apply a roller bandage:</p><ul><li>keep the rolled part of the bandage above the injury and the unrolled part below the injury</li><li>begin by wrapping twice around the injury to hold the end in place</li><li>work up the limb, winding the bandage in spiralling turns, making sure that each new layer covers one-third to two-thirds of the previous one</li><li>finish by wrapping the bandage around once more and securing the end</li></ul><p>When applying bandages to elbows and knees (to hold dressings in place or support sprains or strains) flex the joint slightly, apply the bandage in a figure of eight and extend the bandage quite far on each side of the joint.</p><p>When applying bandages on hands (to hold dressings in place or to support sprains and strains), work from the inside of the wrist using diagonal turns across the back of the hand to the end of the little finger, leaving the thumb free.</p><h3>Tubular bandages</h3><p>Tubular bandages are used to hold dressings on fingers or toes or support injured joints. They are made of seamless fabric tube. You can get elasticated ones to place over joints such as the ankle. Ones made of tubular gauze can be placed over fingers or toes, but they do not provide any pressure to stop bleeding.</p><p>Before placing a tubular bandage over an injury, you may need to cut it to a smaller size. Some tubular bandages come with a special device (an applicator) that is placed over the injured body part to help apply the bandage.</p><h3>Triangular bandages</h3><p>Triangular bandages can be used as large dressings, as slings to support a limb, or to secure a dressing in place.</p><p>If you are using a triangular bandage as a sling on an arm, you use it opened out. You should:</p><ul><li>ask the person to hold their arm across their chest and support the arm while you work</li><li>put the bandage under the arm and around the back of the neck</li><li>put the other half of the bandage over the arm to meet at the shoulder and tie into a knot</li><li>tuck the loose ends of the bandage in at the elbow, or use a pin</li></ul><p>If you are using a triangular bandage to support a lower limb or large dressing, fold it in half horizontally, so the point of the triangle touches the middle of the long edge.

They allow broken bones in the arm or leg to heal by holding them in place, and usually need to stay on for 4 and 12 weeks.</p><p>Taking good care of your cast will help ensure a better recovery.</p><h3>Plaster cast care advice</h3><p>Keep your arm or leg raised on a soft surface, such as a pillow, for as long as possible in the first few days. This will help any swelling to go down and will help the cast dry correctly.</p><p>Don't get your plaster cast wet. This will weaken it, and your bone will no longer be properly supported.</p><p>You can use a plastic bag to cover up the cast when you have a bath or shower. Try using sticky tape or a rubber band to seal the bag at the top and bottom to make it as watertight as possible.</p><p>Alternatively, it is possible to buy special covers for plaster casts to keep them dry. Ask your local pharmacist (chemist) for more information. If your cast gets wet, contact your hospital for advice as soon as possible.</p><p>Always remove the bag as soon as you can to avoid causing sweating, which could also damage the cast.</p><p>Even if the plaster cast makes your skin feel very itchy, don't be tempted to poke anything underneath it, as this could cause a nasty sore. The itchiness should settle down after a few days.</p><h3>More plaster cast tips</h3><ul><li>Exercise any joints that aren't covered by the cast – such as your elbow, knee, fingers or toes – to help improve your circulation.</li><li>Avoid getting small objects, powders and sprays inside your cast, as they could irritate your skin.</li><li>Don't try to alter the length or position of your cast.</li><li>Don't lift anything heavy or drive until the cast has been removed.</li><li>Use crutches or a sling, as advised by your health professional.</li><li>Use painkillers if you experience any pain.</li></ul><p>You can usually return to school or work with a cast, but you should avoid strenuous activities that may damage the broken bone or cast.</p><h3>Plaster cast problems</h3><p>You should go to your local hospital's accident and emergency (A&E) department if:</p><ul><li>your plaster cast still feels too tight after keeping it elevated for 24 hours</li><li>your fingers or toes on the affected limb feel swollen, tingly, painful (even after taking painkillers) or numb</li><li>your fingers or toes turn blue or white</li><li>your cast feels too loose</li><li>your cast is broken or cracked</li><li>the skin underneath or around the edge of your cast feels sore</li><li>there is an unpleasant smell or discharge coming from your cast.</li></ul></body></html>"

If the wound is shallow, (less than 5cm long), clean and uninfected, and you are sure that there is nothing embedded in it, butterfly strips can be used. Make sure the skin around the wound is also clean and dry. Its not always necessary to use the full length of the strips, and you can cut them to a more appropriate length. Leave about 3mm between each strip.</p><ul><li>Carefully line up the edges of the wound.</li><li>Push them together, and, starting at the middle of the wound, apply the strips to keep the edges closed.</li><li>Place half of the strip on one side of the wound, bring the edges together by gently bringing the other side towards it, and then pass the strip over.</li><li>Place strips alternately above and below the first strip – this helps to match up the edges and keeps the skin tension equal.</li><li>To anchor the rows of strips in place, put two strips across the rows (one on each side of the wound).</li></ul><p>A protective dressing is not usually necessary, but the wound must be kept dry until the strips are removed (around three to five days if on the head, or 10-14 days for cuts over the joints). If the strips are difficult to remove, it may help to moisten them with warm water for around 10 minutes. If the wound does not stop bleeding once the strips have been applied, this is a sign that butterfly stitches are not suitable. You should seek medical advice, as another method of treating the wound may be required.</p></body></html>"

Your healthcare professional will tell you when you can get your stitches wet or if they need to be kept dry. This may depend on what kind of wound and dressing you have.</p><h3>When can I have a bath or shower after surgery?</h3><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says that it's safe to shower 48 hours after surgery. After 48 hours, surgical wounds can get wet without increasing the risk of infection. After this time, you can get your stitches wet briefly with a light spray (such as in the shower), but they shouldn't be soaked (for example, in the bath). Make sure you pat the area dry afterwards.</p><h3>Dressings</h3><p>If you have a dressing over your stitches, avoid getting it wet. Some dressings are waterproof, so you could wet your dressing lightly – for example, with the spray from a shower. However, you shouldn't submerge your dressing under water. If you're not sure whether your dressing is waterproof, avoid getting it wet.</p><h3>Keeping stitches dry</h3><p>If you have been advised to keep your stitches dry, you could:</p><ul><li>cover your stitches when you have a bath or shower – for example, with a special waterproof cover, or you could use a rubber glove or plastic bag</li><li>have a wash standing in a bath, using a cloth to clean yourself and avoiding your stitches</li><li>dab your stitches dry with a clean towel after washing, even if the wound area didn't get wet, to ensure the area is completely dry</li></ul><p>If your stitches get wet accidentally, simply dry the area immediately with a clean towel and make sure all the moisture around the stitches is soaked up.</p></body></html>"

Your healthcare professional should tell you how to care for your wound. If you are unsure what to do, ask your healthcare team for advice.</p><h3>Protect your stitches</h3><p>It's important not to scratch your stitches; even though they’re strong, scratching may damage them. You should avoid contact sports, such as football or hockey, to give your wound the best possible chance to heal. You should also not go swimming until your wound has healed and your stitches have been removed. If your child has stitches, don't let them play with water, mud, sand and paint. Playing with things like these could cause the wound area to get dirty or sore, or cause an infection. Children may also be advised to avoid PE at school until their wound has healed.</p><h3>Signs of infection</h3><p>As well as protecting your stitches, watch out for any signs of infection, such as:</p><ul><li>swelling</li><li>increased redness around the wound</li><li>pus or bleeding from the wound</li><li>the wound feeling warm</li><li>an unpleasant smell from the wound</li><li>ncreasing pain</li><li>a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above</li><li>swollen glands</li></ul><h3>Removing stitches</h3><p>You will be told if you need to return to your GP or a nurse to have your stitches removed.

They will not put the glue inside your wound. More than one layer of glue will probably be needed.</p><h3>How long does skin glue take to set?</h3><p>The first layer of skin glue takes only a few minutes to set. It forms a protective covering over your wound. Other layers may take a little longer to set. While the glue is setting, your doctor or nurse will try to stop it running on to anything else, such as other parts of your body or your clothes. For example, if your wound is on your face, while they apply the glue, they may put a piece of gauze over other parts of your face, such as your eye.</p><h3>Will the glue affect how my wound heals?</h3><p>Most wounds closed with skin glue heal normally. Research has shown that there's a slightly higher risk that some wounds may break open again (dehisce) than wounds closed with other methods, such as stitches. However, this risk is small. The scar from your wound will probably take about six months to fade. Some research studies have found that wounds closed with skin glue may leave neater scars than other methods, such as stitches and adhesive tape.</p><h3>Will I need a dressing on my wound as well?</h3><p>If your wound is likely to get dirty, your doctor or nurse may put another dressing on top of the skin glue to keep it clean. Otherwise, you may not need any other dressing for your wound.</p></body></html>"
