Make sure the thermometer is clean and that you read the manufacturer's instructions first. \n\n\bChildren\nIf you're taking a child's temperature, stay with them during the reading and put the thermometer away afterwards so they don't play with it.\n\n\bChoosing a thermometer\nYou can buy a thermometer from your local pharmacy. Different types are available:\n● Digital thermometers are an accurate and easy way to take a temperature from the armpit or mouth. For children under five, take their temperature from under their armpit.\n● Ear thermometers are quick and easy to use, but expensive. The reading may not be accurate if the thermometer isn't correctly placed in the ear.\n● Strip-type thermometers are not an accurate way of taking a temperature. They show the temperature of the skin, not the body.\n● Mercury-in-glass thermometers are no longer sold and should not be used. They can break, releasing small shards of glass and highly poisonous mercury.\n\n\bWhat's a high temperature?\n● A fever (high temperature) is generally considered to be 38C (100.4F) or over."
